## First: 

I made a demographic_analysis.sql file in which we are just going to see the average retention rate among men vs women vs the city tier. 

using this command I got to see the results: 
SELECT * FROM public.demographic_analysis;

The output is: 
gender	citytier	retention_rate
Female	1	0.880721221
Female	2	0.675675676
Female	3	0.791780822
Male	1	0.838129496
Male	2	0.857142857
Male	3	0.782258065

From this output we can conclude that Female living in the tier 1 cities shows more retention than male in any tier cities. 

Female in the tier 2 cities shows significantly less retention so the reason needs to be investigate.
