## First: 

I made a demographic_analysis.sql file in which we are just going to see the average retention rate among men vs women vs the city tier. 

using this command I got to see the results: 
SELECT * FROM public.demographic_analysis;

The output is: 
gender	citytier	retention_rate
Female	1	0.880721221
Female	2	0.675675676
Female	3	0.791780822
Male	1	0.838129496
Male	2	0.857142857
Male	3	0.782258065

Analysis: 

Overall Retention by Gender:
Female customers have retention rates of 88.07% in CityTier 1, 67.57% in CityTier 2, and 79.18% in CityTier 3.
Male customers have retention rates of 83.81% in CityTier 1, 85.71% in CityTier 2, and 78.23% in CityTier 3.

CityTier Impact:
For Female customers, the highest retention rate is in CityTier 1 (88.07%) and the lowest in CityTier 2 (67.57%).
For Male customers, the highest retention rate is in CityTier 2 (85.71%) and the lowest in CityTier 3 (78.23%).

Gender Differences:
In CityTier 1, Female customers have a slightly higher retention rate than Male customers.
In CityTier 2, Male customers have a significantly higher retention rate than Female customers.
In CityTier 3, the retention rates for both genders are closer, but Female customers have a slightly higher rate.

CityTier Preferences:
CityTier 2 appears to be less favorable for Female customers compared to other tiers.
Male customers show relatively consistent retention rates across all CityTiers, with a slight preference for CityTier 2.

Implications for Business Strategy:
Targeted Marketing: Different marketing strategies may be required for different CityTiers, especially focusing on CityTier 2 for Female customers to improve retention.
Customer Experience Improvement: Investigate potential reasons for lower retention in specific tiers and genders. This might involve surveying customer satisfaction, service quality, product availability, etc.
Product and Service Tailoring: Consider tailoring products or services to better suit the preferences of customers in different CityTiers or of different genders.

Further Analysis:
Explore Underlying Causes: Investigate why certain CityTiers have lower retention rates for specific genders. This might involve more detailed data analysis or qualitative research.
Additional Factors: Consider analyzing other factors (like age, income level, product preferences) that might also impact customer retention.

Order Count:

Female customers in CityTier 1 have the highest average order count (3.04), while those in CityTier 2 have the lowest (2.38).
Male customers show less variation across CityTiers in average order count, with the highest in CityTier 3 (3.09) and the lowest in CityTier 2 (2.91).
Cashback Amount:

Female customers in CityTier 2 receive the highest average cashback (194.98), whereas those in CityTier 1 receive the lowest (180.06).
Male customers in CityTier 2 also receive slightly higher average cashback than in other tiers.
Coupon Usage:

Female customers in CityTier 3 use more coupons on average (2.03) compared to those in other tiers.
Male customers in CityTier 1 and 3 use coupons more frequently than those in CityTier 2.
Satisfaction Score:

Female customers in CityTier 1 have a slightly higher average satisfaction score (3.14) compared to other tiers.
Male customers show similar satisfaction scores across all CityTiers, with a slightly higher score in CityTier 2 (3.14).
Total Customers:

The total number of customers varies significantly across different segments, with the highest being Male customers in CityTier 1 (1864) and the lowest being Female customers in CityTier 2 (50).
Business Implications:
Targeted Marketing and Promotions: CityTier 2, especially for Female customers, shows lower average order counts but higher cashback amounts and coupon usage. This may indicate a more price-sensitive segment where promotions could be effective.
Customer Satisfaction Efforts: While satisfaction scores are relatively consistent, small variations could guide improvements in customer service or product offerings.
Resource Allocation: The significant differences in customer count across segments suggest that resources and marketing efforts could be allocated differently to optimize impact.
Understanding Customer Behavior: The differences in order count and coupon usage across genders and city tiers could reflect varying shopping habits and preferences that can inform product, marketing, and sales strategies.
Further Analysis:
Deeper Dive into High and Low Segments: Further investigate the behavior of segments with particularly high or low metrics to understand the driving factors.
Correlate with Other Data: If more data is available (e.g., specific product categories, time of purchases, customer feedback), correlating these metrics with such data could yield richer insights.

Customer Retention Strategies: Focus on reducing churn in high-churn categories by improving product offerings, customer service, or pricing strategies.
Targeted Marketing: Tailor marketing efforts based on popular categories in different CityTiers and among different genders.
Product Focus: Consider emphasizing products in categories with lower churn rates and higher order counts.
Further Analysis:
Investigate specific reasons for high churn rates in certain categories and CityTiers.
Analyze if there are any external factors (like seasonal trends, promotional campaigns) affecting these patterns.


-- tenure_engagement_analysis

High Retention in Specific Groups: Customers with longer tenure (e.g., more than 10 years) and higher app usage (e.g., 3-4 hours) generally show higher retention rates across both genders and CityTiers.

Gender and CityTier Trends: Both Male and Female customers in CityTier 1 and 3 exhibit higher retention rates with increasing tenure and app usage.

Initial Engagement: New customers (Tenure = 0) show varied retention rates, suggesting the importance of initial engagement strategies.

App Usage Correlation: Higher app usage seems correlated with better retention, especially in customers with mid to high tenure.

Segment-Specific Strategies: Tailored strategies for different tenure and app usage segments may enhance retention, considering the distinct patterns observed in different groups.
