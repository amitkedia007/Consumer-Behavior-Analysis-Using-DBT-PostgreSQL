## First: 

I made a demographic_analysis.sql file in which we are just going to see the average retention rate among men vs women vs the city tier. 

using this command I got to see the results: 
SELECT * FROM public.demographic_analysis;

The output is: 
gender	citytier	retention_rate
Female	1	0.880721221
Female	2	0.675675676
Female	3	0.791780822
Male	1	0.838129496
Male	2	0.857142857
Male	3	0.782258065

Gender Differences:
In CityTier 1, Female customers have a slightly higher retention rate than Male customers.
In CityTier 2, Male customers have a significantly higher retention rate than Female customers.
In CityTier 3, the retention rates for both genders are closer, but Female customers have a slightly higher rate.

CityTier Preferences:
CityTier 2 appears to be less favorable for Female customers compared to other tiers.
Male customers show relatively consistent retention rates across all CityTiers, with a slight preference for CityTier 2.

Implications for Business Strategy:
Targeted Marketing: Different marketing strategies may be required for different CityTiers, especially focusing on CityTier 2 for Female customers to improve retention.
Customer Experience Improvement: Investigate potential reasons for lower retention in specific tiers and genders. This might involve surveying customer satisfaction, service quality, product availability, etc.
Product and Service Tailoring: Consider tailoring products or services to better suit the preferences of customers in different CityTiers or of different genders.

Further Analysis:

Business Implications:
Targeted Marketing and Promotions: CityTier 2, especially for Female customers, shows lower average order counts but higher cashback amounts and coupon usage. This may indicate a more price-sensitive segment where promotions could be effective.
Customer Satisfaction Efforts: While satisfaction scores are relatively consistent, small variations could guide improvements in customer service or product offerings.
Resource Allocation: The significant differences in customer count across segments suggest that resources and marketing efforts could be allocated differently to optimize impact.
Understanding Customer Behavior: The differences in order count and coupon usage across genders and city tiers could reflect varying shopping habits and preferences that can inform product, marketing, and sales strategies.
Further Analysis:
Deeper Dive into High and Low Segments: Further investigate the behavior of segments with particularly high or low metrics to understand the driving factors.
Correlate with Other Data: If more data is available (e.g., specific product categories, time of purchases, customer feedback), correlating these metrics with such data could yield richer insights.
